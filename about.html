        <h1> About the Typhoon Odette (Rai) Relief Map </h1>

        <p>On December 16 typhoon Odette hit the Philippines. The storm, internationally known as Rai, affected more than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/23/typhoon-rai-more-than-3m-people-directly-affected-in-philippines">3 million people</a> directly. Tens of thousands of houses have been destroyed, hundreds of thousands of people displaced. In the aftermath, water, electricity, mobile signal, cash from ATMs, and much more became a huge problem for many, overnight.</p>
        <p>But, that's not how this story ends.</p>
        <p>All over the affected regions, individuals, businesses, and NGOs are organizing to provide relief and rebuild. We created the <a href="./">Odette Relief Map</a> to make these projects more visible.</p>

        <h2>Why a map?</h2>
        <p>There are many local community efforts underway that could use help. At the same time we got asked by friends overseas how to help, and where. We created this map to highlight these community efforts, so people like you can find them and support them.</p>

        <h2>What do the markers mean?</h2>
        <p>Purple are NGOs, green are individuals or other non-organizations. Consider going purple, since NGOs have usually a better capacity to use the money.</p>

        <h2>How can I help?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Consider donating to relief efforts, if you can. <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/6-ways-donate-typhoon-rai-130049926.html">Yahoo News has an article about organizations</a> you can support. If you're more into local community efforts—have a look at the map. That's why we built it. :)</li>
            <li>Spread the word about the map.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>How do you find & choose projects?</h2>
        <p>We started with projects from friends, and their friends, or NGOs that we know. After that we added projects that we've seen online or that others recommended.</p>

        <h2>Are those projects 100% verified?</h2>
        <p>No. Please do your own due diligence. We mark how we found a project and try our best to weed out bad apples but if you are not sure simply <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/6-ways-donate-typhoon-rai-130049926.html">donate to the big orgs out there</a>. </p>

        <h2>I want to add a community project, NGO, or relief effort to the map</h2>
